## Airborne Wind Energy (AWE)

Airborne wind energy is a promising approach to
- decentral wind energy harvesting
- offshore wind energy harvesting, in particular for floating offshore systems
- clean ship propulsion

Goals of the OpenSourceAWE organization:
* to support the cooperation between startups and academia
* to develop a complete stack of simulation, estimation, optimization and control software for all major AWE concepts
* by doing so, reduce the costs for developing the initial software stack for startups
* furthermore, to provide reference models for the International Energy Agency (IEA) such that major stackholders can inform themselves about AWE concepts and performance characteristics

So far, our members come from The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and Scotland.
