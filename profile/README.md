## Airborne Wind Energy (AWE)

Airborne wind energy is a promising approach to
- decentral wind energy harvesting
- offshore wind energy harvesting, in particular for floating offshore systems
- clean ship propulsion

Goals of this organization:
* to support the cooperation between startups and academia
* to develop a complete stack of simulation, estimation, optimization and control software for all major AWE concepts
* by doing so, reduce the costs for developing the initial software stack for startups
* furthermore, to provide reference models for the International Energy Agency (IEA) such that major stackholders can inform themselves about AWE concepts and performance characteristics
